title: Amtrak Musings

I’m on an Amtrak right now and just passed by a sign on a bridge that says “Trenton makes -- The world takes”. Bizarre thing to put on a bridge, if you ask me. But if you’re curious about this history, as I was, the slogan comes from a competition hosted in 1910 by the Trenton Chamber of commerce, “to find a slogan for the city's industrial and commercial achievements”. The initial slogan was “The world takes -- Trenton makes”, coined by a lumber yard worker named S. Roy Heath. To me the former seems to put the emphasis on the greed of mankind and not the productivity of Trenton, and does a disservice to Mr. Roy Heath. But anyway.

                         *           *           * 

I’ve been thinking a lot about suffering on this train ride. I’m sitting just behind the handicapped 4-seater and am able to see, in the reflection of the window, an old couple facing me. Of course, in this dark mirror, I begin thinking about death and aging as I always do. 

The window, to me, seemed to be a prison for the both me and the old woman -- a joint reflection of our bodies’ hostages. I, the young trapped in her, the old. She the old, trapped in me the young. While she would eventually overcome me, I would remain forever within her. But how sick of a metaphor, really. I don’t think this is the metaphor to maintain at all.

Our bodies, while temporary, are not prisons at all. And if they are prisons, they are prisons for all of us, indiscriminate of young and old. They’re temporary houses for souls -- “tents” as the Biblical would say. These tents change over the time, as any old 80-year expected-duration material might. Yet, for some reason I always feel sympathy for the old. I know they likely they don’t want or need this at all. They’re in a different phase of the day. Perhaps even happier, moreover, because they are in the process of becoming untethered with their ego while I am holding onto mine for dear life. 

(Sidebar, I’ve always thought that maybe the symptoms of age (and infancy) are simply the soul untethering. As the mind seems to deteriorate, perhaps it is allocating space elsewhere. By contrast, a baby is in the process of allocation. Oedipus noticed first, that the baby walks on four legs and the old person walks on three, while man walks on two. Maybe there is something to be said that the baby is more similar to the older person than man. Both in legged-ness… and sometimes diapered-ness). 

Being young often means building your white picket fence and convincing yourself that the game is everything. Ideally, you’re able to create something of some “value” to the world. But to me this is all distraction from the reality that we are suffering pointlessly and death is inevitable for everyone. I’ve experienced depersonalization before, when I was in the eighth grade, and maybe that’s what makes me so hyperfixated on this. But now, too, in the sunrise of my life I tormented by the disregard of the Linkedin posts which flaunt B2B SaaS solutions and boast about 9-9-6 work weeks.I am constantly reminded the quote “do the people on Linkedin know we are going to die”. Perhaps I’m just envious of their ability to disregard death. Isn’t all we can do, in the face of death? Continue to live to the fullest level? Perhaps these people have fully embraced the Sisyphean ideals and I am enviously standing at the bottom of the hill with my rock. 

Regardless, I hope maybe once or twice they have thought of their own mortality because I do think that it is purifying. While I am still in the phase of fear and senseless clutching to my ego pearls, I recognize that this is just a part of the navigation of life. That it’s okay to play the game, and even helpful sometimes, so long as we have the understanding that there is more. The questioning of God, the thoughts of hell and eternal suffering, the disappointment in humanity as I watch all the hatred and degradation and killing of people unfold on a portable screen I carry at all times -- this is all a part of it. And so is the B2B SaaS empire-building. These are all comforts and attempts at understanding ourselves and our position; to derive some meaning and peace. 
	
As for me I have come to think that I am nothing of myself. I am the universe understanding itself, at best. Part of a collective conscious that I do not understand and maybe cannot understand fully until my ego, this body, this tent is stripped away and something entirely new is revealed. Droplets of water that have a momentary identity and then return to the sea. All I can do is try to understand, be compassionate, and love.
