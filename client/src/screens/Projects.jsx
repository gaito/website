        Proofreading is tedious task, which requires lots of human input, and so my team sought to game-ify the process by wrapping the Neuvue platform in a game. Users play as an astronaut and fly through the "universe"
        to make paths, when in reality they are flying through 3D representations of electron microscopy images, and the paths they are making are continuous segments of dendrites and axons. Results pertaining to the

        Data analysis pipelines create reports that are helpful for researchers, but the normalization, PCA reduction, clustering, and visualization can be parameterized 
        in ways that skew results. In this project, I designed data analysis pipelines and modified normalization and visualization hyperparameters to examine downstream effects in the ultimate cell type results.
        I discovered that results are far from definitive, and depending on user input, potentially unique cell clusters could be consolidated. I completed this research beneath
